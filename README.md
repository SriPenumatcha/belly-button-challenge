## How to Use

1. Select a Sample: Use the dropdown menu to select a sample ID. The dashboard will update to display data for the chosen sample.

2. Bar Chart: Displays the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in the selected sample. This chart helps users quickly identify the most prevalent bacteria.

3. Bubble Chart: Visualizes all OTUs present in the sample. Each bubble's size represents the abundance of the OTU, providing a comprehensive view of the sample's bacterial diversity.

4. Metadata Panel: Shows demographic information for the selected sample, including details such as age, gender, and ethnicity, which can provide context for the biodiversity data.
